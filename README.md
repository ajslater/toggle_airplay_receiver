# `toggle_airplay_receiver`

Toggle macOS's airplay receiver on and off.

## Usage

```sh
toggle_airplay_reciever <on|off|toggle>
```

## Notes

Scripting the GUI is a stopgap until I can figure out how to toggle that setting directly.

Based on [a StackOverflow answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/431846/toggle-airplay-receiver-server-with-the-command-line-on-macos-monteray/431876#431876).
